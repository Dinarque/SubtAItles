1 00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,978 Hi, this is Eric Griffith. I'm the features editor@pcmag.com, and I'm  
2 00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:07,086 here to tell you how to download YouTube videos. Now,  
3 00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,814 first off, you probably don't have to. It's very simple to  
4 00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,606 share videos from YouTube or almost any video sharing site,  
5 00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:18,618 even Facebook. They provide all sorts of embed codes  
6 00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:22,762 or URLs that you can share via texting or on other websites.  
7 00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:26,626 But you probably have your reason why you need a local copy  
8 00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:29,698 of a video you've seen online. Who are we to judge?  
9 00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:33,142 So go right ahead. We're going to show you how to do it.  
10 00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:36,646 First, you need to pick a software product or service  
11 00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:39,674 that you really like that you think is going to do the job. We have  
12 00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:42,902 many that we recommend right in our story, how to download  
13 00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:46,666 YouTube videos. Second, find the video itself  
14 00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:49,642 over on YouTube or whatever service you're going to use,  
15 00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:53,342 and then copy the URL. It's that simple.  
16 00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:57,354 Take that URL, paste it into the software or service of choice,  
17 00:00:57,482 --> 00:01:01,214 and the software or service will do the work for you.  
18 00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:05,118 It'll do a conversion as it downloads the video and  
19 00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:09,006 will probably give it to you in a slightly lower resolution, which is the  
20 00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,254 price you pay for free. If you're willing to pay for it. You can  
21 00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:15,698 probably get something a little higher in quality. Once you've  
22 00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,790 got it, you can store it locally and do whatever you like with it.  
23 00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,438 Preferably, don't share it with too many people. You're just taking money out of  
24 00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:25,606 the pockets of the creators who made the video. Good luck with your  
25 00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:29,640 downloads. For more, you can always visit PCMag.com.
